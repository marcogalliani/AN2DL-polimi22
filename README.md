# AN2DL-polimi22
Repositories containing all the code from the course "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" at Politecnico di Milano

# HW1: Plant recognition
For the first assignment we worked on an convolutional neural network to recognize 8 different species of plants starting from images of their leaves.

# HW2: Timeseries classification
For the second assignment we worked on different types of recurrent neural networks to classify timeseries in six different classes.
